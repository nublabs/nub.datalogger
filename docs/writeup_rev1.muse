* nublogger
The nublogger is an affordable, wireless datalogger platform to which you can connect any voltage-based sensor and log the recorded data wirelessly to a text file that you can open in any spreadsheet program.  Using the ZigBee wireless protocol, a single dongle is plugged into your computer and appears as a thumb drive.  That dongle can communicate with nearly any number of sensors and log each sensor's data in a separate file.


The nublogger is designed not only to be affordable, but buildable and extensible, as well.  Built on top of the popular Arduino microcontroller platform, it is possible to add sensors 

nublabs is releasing the nublogger under the MIT license
